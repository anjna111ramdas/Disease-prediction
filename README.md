# Disease Prediction from Symptoms

This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict diseases from symptoms. 

### Algorithms Explored

The following algorithms have been explored in code:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting

Disease Prediction system is based on predictive modelling and predicts the disease of the user on the basis of the symptoms that user provides as an input to the system. The system analyses the symptoms provided by the user as an input and gives the probability of the disease as an output
